# SUMON Game - Project 1
## Overview

For project #1, I created a simple Sumon game.

Sumon is a math game. Users choose tiles that add up to the number displayed in the upper right.
Once a player enters the site, the game board is shuffled and a random number is generated and displayed in the upper right. 
The player scores when the display number is reached. The game will then display another random number for the player to match. 
The player can choose to reset the game at any time which will reactivate all tiles and set the score back to 0.
